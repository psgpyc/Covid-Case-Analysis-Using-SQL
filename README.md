# COVID-19 Case Analysis Using SQL

## Project Overview

This repository contains SQL queries designed for analyzing COVID-19 case data. The goal is to provide insights into various aspects of the pandemic, including trends in case numbers, fatalities, and vaccination rates across different regions and time periods.

## Contents

- **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL scripts for data analysis.
- **Datasets**: Information about the datasets used (if applicable).
- **Visualizations**: Future plans to add visualizations using Tableau.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
- Access to a COVID-19 dataset (not included in this repository).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/psgpyc/Covid-Case-Analysis-Using-SQL.git
   ```
## Getting Started

Open your preferred SQL environment.
Execute the SQL queries against your COVID-19 dataset.

## Usage Instructions

To run the provided SQL queries:

1. Open your SQL client.
2. Load your COVID-19 dataset into the database.
3. Copy and paste the SQL queries from this repository into your SQL client and execute them.

## Future Enhancements

### Tableau Visualizations

In addition to SQL queries, I plan to incorporate Tableau visualizations to enhance data analysis and presentation. These visualizations will provide interactive insights into the COVID-19 data, making it easier to understand trends and patterns.
